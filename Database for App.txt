Assumptions:
1) User can UPDATE his/her review n times.
2) Users are identified only by their E-mail IDs, no User Names are required.
3) Technical --> No connection to google for Login. There should a program, who sends a RANDOM password to NEW SIGNED UP users & on Signin up we have to ask user for New Password.

Suggestions are welcome!
